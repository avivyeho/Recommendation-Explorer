## Intro

**Goal:** Agree on design basics

**Idea:** Decide on the fonts and colors to use for the mock ups of our Webapp and later the actual Webapp

**Why:** So that even if different pages of our Webapp are made my different people they still look alike

## Approach

### Things to keep in mind:

- [Mere-exposure effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect): A psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them

Assuming Prof. Goethals spends quite some time on his [Froomle](https://careers.froomle.ai/en) Website using a simmilar design to his should cause him to like our design by mere exposure.

### Basic Building Blocks: (feel free to add if you can think of more)

* Font(s):
  - A main font that is easy to read for all the text
  - *(optional)* A more bold font for the headings
  - *(optional)* A flashy font to use for the main landing page
  
  - Source: [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) ([Plex](https://fonts.google.com/featured/Plex) looks nice)

* Color theme:
  - A selection of a few colours
  - Keep in mind [colour blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness) (coolors lets you check how your colours look when adjusted for colour blindness)
  - Source: [coolors](https://coolors.co)

* Inspiration:
  - Font used on Froomle: [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?preview.text_type=custom)
  - Colour [Palette](https://github.com/tobias-wilfert/recommendation-explorer/blob/main/Project/Froomle_Palette.pdf) used by Froomle
